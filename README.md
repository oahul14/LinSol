### Current schedule

#### By Sunday

1. Jacobi sparse - Ling
2. LU decomposition sparse - Hao
3. Gauss-Seidel - Sokratis

#### The Rest

1. Check if the input matrix is sparse or not
2. Optimisation
	* vecorisation
	* BLAS/LAPACK
	* smart pointers
3. Tests
	* size compatibility
	* compare different solver results
	* compare if solver for sparse and dense are consistent
	* using actual from other resources
4. compare containers of ONE solver, includes:
	* vector of vectors
	* vector
	* pointers
	* smart pointers
